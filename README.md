## Dictionaryâ€“  convert them into a dictionary in a way that item from list1 is the key and item from list2 is the value. Get two lists as input.
###  Aim
To Write a Python program to convert them into a dictionary in a way that item from list1 is the key and item from list2 is the value. Get two lists as input.
###  Algorithm

Step 1: Start the program.
Step 2: Take the necessary input(s) from the user.
Step 3: Process the input(s) using suitable operations or conditions.
Step 4: Display the result/output to the user.
Step 5: Stop the program.


### ðŸ§¾ Program
```

keys=input()
values=input()
keys=eval(keys)
values=eval(values)
result=dict(zip(keys,values))
print(result)

```
